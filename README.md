# ios_shortcuts

A collection of useful personal ios shortcuts.

Currently:
1. reminder url processor: cut url string in the ios reminder title and paste it in url section of the reminder.
  ex. Given a new reminder with title: "Best time to buy stock 2 - https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/  for review!!!",
  the shortcut will change the title to "Best time to buy stock 2 - for review!!!"
  and the reminder's url section will have https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/
